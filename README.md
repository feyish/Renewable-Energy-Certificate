## Overview

This decentralized REC trading platform revolutionizes how renewable energy generation is certified, traded, and tracked through blockchain technology. By creating immutable records of clean energy production and consumption, we establish a transparent, efficient marketplace that reduces costs, eliminates double-counting, and accelerates the transition to renewable energy.

### Mission
To accelerate global decarbonization by creating a trusted, accessible marketplace for renewable energy certificates that connects generators, consumers, and verifiers while ensuring complete integrity of environmental claims.

## Architecture

The platform is built on four foundational smart contract systems that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for REC issuance, trading, verification, and retirement, supported by decentralized storage and IoT integration.

### Core Components:
1. **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum-based contracts handling all aspects of the REC lifecycle
2. **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS for storing supporting documentation and verification evidence
3. **IoT Integration**: Connection with trusted energy meters and monitoring devices
4. **Web Interface**: User-friendly dashboard for all participants
5. **Oracle System**: Integration with external data sources and verification standards

## Smart Contracts

### 1. REC Issuance Contract
Creates and manages the generation of renewable energy certificates
- **Functions**:
    - `issueREC(generatorId, energyAmount, timestamp, sourceType)`: Creates new REC based on verified generation
    - `batchIssueRECs(generatorId, meterReadings[], period)`: Creates multiple RECs from periodic generation data
    - `validateGeneration(generatorId, meterData, timestamp)`: Verifies energy production from trusted sources
    - `adjustRECMetadata(recId, field, newValue, evidence)`: Updates REC information with proper authorization
    - `getGeneratorPortfolio(generatorId)`: Returns all RECs associated with a specific generator

### 2. Trading Contract
Facilitates the marketplace for buying, selling, and transferring RECs
- **Functions**:
    - `listRECForSale(recId, price, expirationDate)`: Makes REC available on the marketplace
    - `createBuyOrder(criteria, maxPrice, quantity)`: Establishes parameters for desired purchases
    - `executeTrade(recId, buyerId, sellerId, price)`: Completes transaction and transfers ownership
    - `batchTransferRECs(recIds[], recipient)`: Transfers multiple RECs in a single transaction
    - `getMarketMetrics()`: Returns current pricing, volume, and trend information

### 3. Verification Contract
Validates the authenticity and compliance of RECs throughout their lifecycle
- **Functions**:
    - `verifyRECOrigin(recId)`: Confirms the generation source and process
    - `certifyRECCompliance(recId, standardId)`: Validates against specific regulatory standards
    - `auditRECHistory(recId)`: Generates complete provenance report
    - `flagSuspiciousActivity(recId, reason)`: Enables reporting of potential issues
    - `resolveVerificationDispute(recId, evidence)`: Handles contestations to verification decisions

### 4. Retirement Contract
Manages the final use and retirement of RECs to prevent double-counting
- **Functions**:
    - `retireREC(recId, purpose, beneficiary)`: Permanently marks REC as used for specific purpose
    - `batchRetireRECs(recIds[], purpose, beneficiary)`: Retires multiple RECs in single transaction
    - `generateRetirementCertificate(recId)`: Creates official documentation of retirement
    - `verifyRetirementClaim(claimId)`: Validates that environmental claims match retired RECs
    - `getRetirementStatistics(organizationId)`: Returns retirement history for reporting

## Getting Started

### For Energy Generators
1. Complete verification:
   ```
   Register generation facility with required documentation
   Connect monitoring equipment for automated readings
   Complete third-party verification process
   ```

2. Issue RECs:
    - Configure automated issuance based on generation
    - Set preferences for REC metadata (location, technology, vintage)
    - Establish pricing strategy for marketplace

3. Track and monetize:
    - Monitor REC issuance and marketplace performance
    - Access real-time pricing data across certificate types
    - Generate compliance reports for regulatory requirements

### For Energy Consumers
1. Create buyer profile:
    - Complete organizational verification
    - Define sustainability goals and REC requirements
    - Set up wallet and payment methods

2. Acquire RECs:
    - Browse marketplace with customizable filters
    - Place buy orders with specific criteria
    - Execute purchases directly or through automated matching

3. Manage environmental claims:
    - Retire RECs for specific reporting periods
    - Generate verifiable proof of renewable energy use
    - Track progress toward sustainability targets

### For Verifiers and Auditors
1. Establish verification credentials:
    - Register as authorized verifier with qualifying documentation
    - Define verification methodology and standards
    - Set up secure oracle connections for external data

2. Perform verification activities:
    - Review generation data and supporting evidence
    - Certify compliance with relevant standards
    - Flag discrepancies for investigation
